Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

**The Gaming Room is a gaming client that wanted help moving their game, Draw it or Lose it, to other platforms (At the time, it only existed on Android devices).**

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

**I feel that I was able to effectively distinguish the advantages, and disadvantages, of each of the operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows, IOS) for Draw it or Lose it. I then chose, and explained, what I felt to be the best primary platform for Draw it or Lose it (Windows).**

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

**The design document was helpful in serving as a guide as I went through the process ofdeveloping the code for Draw it or Lose it.**

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

**The weakest part of my design document was the "Design Constraints" section. In this section I could have done a better job by going into more detail about how specific requirements could have been met.**

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

**The user's needs served as the base of which the software design document was built. I implemented these needs throughout my document, specifically in the sections where I compared the benefits and downsides of each operating system. I ultimately decided that Windows was the best operating system suited for the user's needs.**

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

**I approached the software design document with the user's needs in mind first. I went through each section in the document trying to come up with the best possible outcome for the user. In the future, I should continue to keep the user's best interest in mind, and avoid letting personal preference, or bias, have an overbearing influence.**
