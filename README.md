Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

**The Gaming Room is a gaming client that wanted help moving their game, Draw it or Lose it, to other platforms (At the time, it only existed on Android devices).**

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

**I feel that I was able to effectively distinguish the advantages, and disadvantages, of each of the operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows, IOS) for Draw it or Lose it. I then chose, and explained, what I felt to be the best primary platform for Draw it or Lose it (Windows).**

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

**The design document was helpful in serving as a guide as I went through the process ofdeveloping the code for Draw it or Lose it.**

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

**The weakest part of my design document was the "Design Constraints" section. In this section I could have done a better job by going into more detail about how specific requirements could have been met.**

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?



How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
